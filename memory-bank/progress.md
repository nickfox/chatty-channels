## Completed Tasks

*   **[2025-04-11]** Defined overall "Chatty Channels" vision and architecture.
*   **[2025-04-11]** Established V1 scope: `AIproducer` Swift app (chat, Gemini, state persistence).
*   **[2025-04-11]** Resolved initial Gemini API connection issues.
*   **[2025-04-11]** Documented V2+ roadmap features (advanced `AIplayer` capabilities).
*   **[2025-04-11]** Defined Nichols Vocal Flow Engine (NVFE) instruction set (`nvfe.txt`).

## Current Tasks

*   **Implement V1 `AIproducer` Swift App:**
    *   Develop SwiftUI UI ("Control Room").
    *   Integrate `NetworkService` for Gemini API calls.
    *   Implement `ChatModel` for state management and persistence.
    *   Ensure production quality standards (logging, error handling, etc.).

## Next Steps

*   **V1 Completion:** Finalize and test the `AIproducer` Swift app.
*   **V2 Planning:** Detail the architecture and implementation plan for JUCE plugins (`AIplayer`, `AIdrummer`, etc.), OSC communication, advanced features (unmasking, balancing, MIDI generation), and NVFE integration.
*   **V2 Implementation:** Begin development of the JUCE plugins, inter-app communication, and NVFE logic within AI agents.
