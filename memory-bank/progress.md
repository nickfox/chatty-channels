## Completed Tasks

*   **[2025-04-11]** Defined overall "Chatty Channels" vision and architecture.
*   **[2025-04-11]** Established V1 scope: `AIproducer` Swift app (chat, Gemini, state persistence).
*   **[2025-04-11]** Resolved initial Gemini API connection issues.
*   **[2025-04-11]** Documented V2+ roadmap features (advanced `AIplayer` capabilities).
*   **[2025-04-11]** Defined Nichols Vocal Flow Engine (NVFE) instruction set (`nvfe.txt`).
*   **[2025-04-11]** Setup AIplayer JUCE project (v0.2): Created project, integrated `juce_osc`, built AU, verified load in Logic Pro.

## Current Tasks

*   **(V1 - On Hold)** Implement V1 `AIproducer` Swift App.
*   **Implement AIplayer Plugin (v0.2+):**
    *   Develop basic plugin editor UI.
    *   Implement core audio pass-through or basic processing.
    *   Refine OSC communication logic (sending/receiving).
## Next Steps

*   **(V1 - On Hold)** Finalize and test the `AIproducer` Swift app.
*   **V2 Implementation (AIplayer Focus):** Continue development of the `AIplayer` JUCE plugin (UI, DSP, OSC). Plan and implement other V2 features (`AIdrummer`, advanced capabilities, NVFE) subsequently.
